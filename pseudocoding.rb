# 1)  Create a discount service to implement discounts logic
#      a)  Discount for total purchase: discount = 10% if total > 800
#      b)  Discount for guitars: if guitars.count >= 2 => guitar_price = 655 => Dicount_by_guitars = guitar_cuantity.(original_price - discounted_price)
#      c)  Discount for total items of the same type:  discount = 5% if total_items >= 4
